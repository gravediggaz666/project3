<h2>1972 CHEVROLET C10!</h2>
 <img src="photos/C10.jpeg" alt="chevy" id="C10">
 <h3>INTERIOR:</h3>
 <p> Genuine leather upholstery on the doors and seat. Custom two tone gray with 
 yellow piping. The headliner is custom made. The metal trim is painted yellow. Polished 
 instrument panel matches the glovebox. It has a set of white face gauges, chrome tilt 
 column and a custom wheel. It also has billet knobs, pedals and armrests.</p>

<h3>ENGINE COMPARTMENT:</h3> 
<p>It has a wow factor when you open the hood. Plenty of polished parts, high gloss paint 
and one of the coolest air cleaners I've seen. That's a ZZ4 GM crate 350-330 hp motor, 
reliable and strong. The intake is highly polished. Has dual feed Holley carb with electric
 choke and premium fittings. The front of the motor has a March drive system with billet
  brackets, serpentine belt, polished mini compressor, polished alternator and power 
  steering. The power brake system is chrome. A big aluminum radiator with 2 electric fans
   keeps it cool. It also has braided stainless dipsticks, billet wire holders, aluminum 
   valve covers and more. The engine bay is all smoothed out and painted gloss yellow. 
   Wires are hidden, a/c lines are custom.</p>

<h3>TRUNK COMPARTMENT:</h3> 
<p>It has a spray in Line-X bedliner that was color matched. Now it's durable, you could 
throw whatever you want in the bed. It is straight and rust free. The tailgate has the 
latch relocated to the inside, the fuel door is relocated to the floor.</p>

<h3>UNDERSIDE:</h3> 
<p>The front end looks like it was completely rebuilt. The bushings, shocks, springs, 
balljoints, steering components were replaced. It has 2 inch drop spindles, swaybars 
front and back. In back the trailing arms have new bushings and the shocks were replaced. 
Drilled disc brakes at all four wheels. The exhaust is a custom 2 into 1 with a Flowmaster
 muffler and splitter tips. Looking up at the motor it still looks practically new, there's
  a chrome flywheel cover. Upgraded with the 4L60E electronic automatic overdrive, it also
   has an aluminum pan and an external cooler. 12 bolt rear end has an aluminum finned cover.
    The frame and chassis is smooth black, the floors are solid clean metal that have been
     sprayed with a black chipgard.</p>
